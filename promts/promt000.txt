Redis memory cache cluster

# Context

The banking application is experiencing high latency in handling frequent read operations, such as product catalog inquiries, campaigns reads, dictionary data reads.
The data is stored in a relational database (Oracle).

The issues of current architecture:
- Increased database load.
- Slower response times under high traffic.
- Difficulty to scale for a good user experience.

Note: Redis is used by other microservices of the bank's applications.

===== DATA ADR =====
--- file: docs/md/ADRs/ADR0/data/decision.md
# Decision
Implement a Redis memory cache cluster as a distributed caching solution for frequently accessed data in the banking application.

Redis will be deployed as a high-availability cluster with:
- Primary-Replica setup for fault tolerance
- Cluster mode enabled for horizontal scalability

Cache invalidation will be managed through:
- Time-to-Live (TTL) policies for short-lived data.
- Event-based data eviction - maybe in the future.

===== BUSINESS CONTEXT =====
--- file: docs/md/ADRs/business_context/README.md
# Business Context

Purpose:
Provide domain background so ADR decisions align with real constraints and goals.

## Solution Context: AI-Powered ADR Generation and Validation Assistant
Goal: Automate high-quality, template-compliant ADRs via CustomGPT with faster turnaround, explicit assumptions, and full traceability.

Drivers:
- Manual ADRs slow / inconsistent.
- Missing assumptions & validation.
- Stale docs hurt onboarding & governance.
- Hard to enforce uniform quality.
- Limited budget for implementation.

Stakeholders: Architecture (govern), Engineering squads (produce/use), Compliance/Risk (audit), Product (visibility), ML/Platform (model ops).

Operational Modes:
1. Input Analysis – Parse artifacts (prompts, diffs, tickets) → extract context, constraints, quality attributes, risks.
2. ADR Drafting – Generate structured ADR (Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences, Assumptions) + inferred assumptions.
3. Validation – Compare to exemplars → score completeness, template conformity, terminology consistency → produce Validation Summary.

Lifecycle: Input Package → Parsed Context → Draft ADR → Validated ADR → Published ADR → Archived (superseded). Assumptions catalog accumulates reusable assumptions.

Non-functional Priorities:
- Accuracy (constraint extraction).
- Latency <10s typical set.
- Availability ≥99.5%.
- Traceability (artifact hashes).
- Data isolation (sandboxed model).
- Observability (gen + validation metrics).

Compliance:
- Secure handling of proprietary artifacts.
- Audit log (input, output, scores).
- Explainability (source snippet links).

Risks & Mitigations:
- Prompt injection / artifact poisoning → sanitization + controlled retrieval.
- Hallucinated assumptions → source citation + reviewer flag.
- Template drift → version tagging + regression tests.

KPIs:
- Generation time reduction.
- Template compliance ≥95%.
- Validation precision.
- Assumptions detected / ADR.
- Adoption ratio.
- Freshness (% ADRs updated within SLA).
- Lightweight satisfaction score.

Integration Boundaries:
- VCS (diffs, PR metadata)
- Ticketing (Jira/Linear)
- ADR repository (exemplars)
- Policy/Secrets store
- Notification (Slack)

Pain Points (condensed):
- Siloed tacit knowledge.
- Undocumented reasoning → rework.
- Format inconsistency.
- Low discoverability.

Guidelines:
- Keep business focus; exclude low-level implementation.
- Update modes if workflow changes.
- Review KPIs quarterly; retire unused.

===== ADR TEMPLATE =====
--- file: docs/md/ADRs/template/ADR-YYYYMMDD-template.md
# ADR <Short Title>

## Status
<!-- List of statuses: proposed, accepted, rejected, superseded, deprecated -->
Proposed

## Context
<!-- Why a decision is needed now. Business drivers, constraints, assumptions. -->
**Business problem**: <what outcome we need, who benefits>
**Constraints**: <time, budget, regulatory, tech>
**Assumptions**: <things believed true>
**Out of scope**: <explicitly excluded items>

## Decision
<!-- The selected option and why it wins. -->
**Chosen option**: <Option X>
**Primary rationale**: <top 3 reasons (business + technical)>

## Consequences
**Positive**
- <benefit 1>
- <benefit 2>

**Negative / Trade-offs**
- <trade-off 1>
- <new obligations, debt, vendor lock-in, complexity>

===== DATA ADR =====
--- file: docs/md/ADRs/ADR1/data/Solution1.md
Solution1: Use CustomGPT and MCP server(GitHub) as repository to store and manage ADRs.
Create a system that leverages CustomGPT for drafting and validating Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) while using an MCP server (GitHub) as the repository for storing and managing ADRs.
The system will consist of the following components:
CustomGPT Integration: Utilize CustomGPT to draft ADRs based on user-provided context, constraints, and options, ensuring adherence to the official ADR template.
MCP Server (GitHub):
Use Default CustomGPT interface to connect to a GitHub repository that serves as the MCP server for storing ADRs.

--- file: docs/md/ADRs/ADR1/data/Solution2.md
Solution1: Use RAG and LLM API integration.
Create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) API to draft and validate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
The system will consist of the following components:
Vector Database: Store embeddings of existing ADRs, templates, and relevant documentation for efficient retrieval.
Embedding Model: Use a pre-trained embedding model to convert text data into vector representations.
RAG Pipeline: Implement a RAG pipeline that retrieves relevant documents from the vector database based on user input and uses the LLM API to generate ADR drafts.
User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for users to input context, constraints, and options, and receive drafted ADRs.
Validation Module: Create a module that compares drafted ADRs against example ADRs for format, tone, and completeness, producing a validation summary.
By integrating RAG with an LLM API, the system can generate precise and evidence-backed ADRs while ensuring adherence to the official ADR template.

Solution3 (preferred): ssh command to prepare context for CustomGPT.
//   - "MODE: DRAFTING" when drafting ADRs.
//   - "MODE: VALIDATION" when validating ADRs.
Example command: prepare_adr.sh

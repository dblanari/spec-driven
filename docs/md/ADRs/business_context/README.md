# Business Context

Purpose:
Provide domain background so ADR decisions align with real constraints and goals.

Include:
- Domain overview (e.g., payment system: actors, flows, settlement, reconciliation).
- Key entities & lifecycle.
- Regulatory / compliance constraints.
- Non-functional priorities (latency targets, throughput, availability, data retention).
- Risk posture & security considerations.
- KPIs & success metrics (e.g., authorization success rate, fraud detection precision).
- Integration boundaries (external processors, ledger, notification services).
- Current pain points / drivers for change.

Guidelines:
Keep factual; avoid embedding decisions (those go into ADRs). Update when business rules or KPIs change.
